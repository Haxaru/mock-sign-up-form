# mock-sign-up-form

I created the webpage before I attempted to make it a functioning sign up page first.

I had to modify some of the css. I mistakenly left out the submit button from the form, and changing the layout of it caused many visual errors.

I added some JavaScript and visual css validators. One thing I struggled with was ensuring the text length was more than 0. Instead of using .value, I'd use .length.

It doesn't scale amazingly but I did try to add some resizing abilities for the page

Either way refreshing up on JavaScript was very enjoyable and it was nice to apply it to a mock form page :)
